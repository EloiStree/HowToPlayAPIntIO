Welcome 🧙‍♂️!!!

If you're here, it means you want to play with us on [APInt.IO](https://apint.io/) 🍺😁

Depending on the game, we’re using either a keyboard or an Xbox controller.

**Note:** I have a busy life, so my stream is *your* stream.  
I'm on Discord if you need help learning, but I won’t be a "streamer".  
I’m not the focus — the code and the fun of learning are! 😉
